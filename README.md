This script to manage hexo for post or other writings in case use **gitbook** as text editor. Actually you need to run it manually. Next time I will add it to tray system. 

This script will automatically
- generate table index called **SUMMARY.md**
- "smart" deployment to github

# How to use
file executable will be placed in ```Project_folder/source/space/import/Book_name```, please, entered a correct directory. If you in put it to another place script will be failed.

```
cd Project_8log/source/space/import/cisco
```

After that, clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/bimsky/gitbook2hexo .
```

execute
```
./sed.sh
```

# Thanks ...
